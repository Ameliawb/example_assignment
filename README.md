#Ancestral Technology

Look back into your family, distant past, family you have met, and your future generations.
What technology was used by your relatives, and what seeds do you wish to plant into your current projects that you want to be embeded into the mainframe of what your distant Descendants will have as a bug in their future code.


## Getting Started

Once you choose a technology, create your chosen ancestral technology with a current technology. Example: [my own research on blockchain and wampum](https://immerse.news/decentralized-storytelling-d8450490b3ee)
, or hand woven looms and binary.
