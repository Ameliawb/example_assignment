# Ancestral Technology

Look back into your family, distant past, family you have met, and your future generations.
What technology was used by your relatives, and what seeds do you wish to plant into your current projects that you want to be embeded into the mainframe of what your distant Descendants will have as a bug in their future code.

## Getting Started

Once you choose a technology, create your chosen ancestral technology with a current technology. Example: [my own research on blockchain and wampum](https://immerse.news/decentralized-storytelling-d8450490b3ee)
, or hand woven looms and binary.  

### Quote from Decentralized Storytelling (from the professor)

We teach with stories, and so our stories need to last, to be understood for seven generations. When you understand that then you will know why our way of telling stories — which you might call “decentralized” — makes a whole lot of sense.

We teach with stories, and so our stories need to last.
I approach decentralized storytelling in a Haudenosaunee way: Our current world is the result of seven generations before me. I am interacting with the world designed by my ancestors and yours. My life is a way to communicate with the people born in the future seven generations from now.

Today the stories we tell are embedded in networks and pixels instead of wampum and rivers, but they may still have the power to last through seven generations, to influence the lives of my great-great-great-great-great-great grandchildren, for the people I do not yet know, and those I have only met in dreams.
