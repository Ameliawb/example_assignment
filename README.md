# Ancestral Technology

Look back into your family, distant past, family you have met, and your future generations.
What technology was used by your relatives, and what seeds do you wish to plant into your current projects that you want to be embeded into the mainframe of what your distant Descendants will have as a bug in their future code.


## Getting Started

Once you choose a technology, create your chosen ancestral technology with a current technology. Example: [my own research on blockchain and wampum](https://immerse.news/decentralized-storytelling-d8450490b3ee)
, or hand woven looms and binary.  

### Prerequisites

Details on libraries that could be a good fit for this project and  things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

On [date] edit your name to include the link to your prototype in advance of our class crit on [date]

```
Student Name [ insert link to project ] on date
```

and keep it up to date

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests
